Lyric poetry is when poets write about their own feelings and thoughts, like songs or poems about being sad or happy.

Narrative poetry tells a story with characters and events, just like a regular story but written in poem form with rhymes or special rhythm.

Dramatic poetry is meant to be performed out loud, where someone acts like a character and speaks their thoughts and feelings to an audience (acting in a theatre).
